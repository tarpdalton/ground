Ground is an open-source data context service under development in UC Berkeley's [RISE Lab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/). Ground serves as a central model, API, and repository for capturing the broad context in which data is used. Our goal is to address practical problems for the Big Data community in the short term and to open up opportunities for long-term research and innovation.

For the vision behind Ground, please see our [CIDR '17](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2017/) [publication](docs/CIDR17.pdf).

## Getting Started
You can download the latest version of Ground from our [releases page](https://github.com/ground-context/ground/releases).
The most recent version of Ground is [**v0.1**](https://github.com/ground-context/ground/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

Once you have downloaded the latest version of Ground, you can start the Ground server by running `./bin/ground-postgres`.*
This starts a local Ground server running on port 9000.
